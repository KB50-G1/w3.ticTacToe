w3.ticTacToe
============

In this assignment you will have to make an app together with the project group. In this assignment you are going to make the game tic tac toe (in Dutch: Boter kaas en eieren). The game works as follows:

* Every square is a button
* When a button is pressed its text is changed in either X or O.
* The player (that is you) starts by making a move.
* The computer reacts automatically with a random allowed move.
* When you lost or won a message appears in a label which was not visible before. No more moves can be made then.
* There is a button which resets the game.

Next to these requirements there are also a number of non-functional requirements like:

* When the orientation of the device changes the screen with the playing field also has to adjust to the new orientation.
* The size of the buttons in which an X or O appears has to be the same on different screens (example mdpi, hdpi etc.). Next to that the size of the buttons needs to stay the same when the orientation of the screen has changed. 
* Give your app an Icon which you made yourself.

There are some remaining remarks:

* Pay attention to the fact that half way the game the orientation of the screen can be changed
* Instead of a random move the computer can also make a smart move. Using a smart algorithm for this can lead to a higher grade. This should be however a smart, compact, maintainable and expendable algorithm.
